# Welcome to batch-one-automation
This is the official repository for the Towards Automation Engineer Program for Batch One ,

This is a tiny project that only exists to welcome newcomers to the GitHub process. If you are totally new to the Git and GitHub thing and you need a safe place to figure out how to clone a repository, make a change, and create a pull request, you're in the right place.

Give it a try!

I'm not going to judge you for trying and I'm not going to judge you for making mistakes. (I'm not going to judge you at all if you're here to learn!) There's no reason to be here besides figuring out how all of this works, so you're in great company if you make a few mistakes. It's just part of the process!

Just go for it!

Your mission is simply to clone the repository, create a branch where you add a positive welcoming or encouraging note for everyone who comes after you, and then create a pull request to have your message added to our wall. Be proud that you have come this far! Be encouraging! Don't ever forget how hard the first few steps of any journey can be.

Thinking way too hard about this? Feel free to copy and paste this message:

Welcome to GitHub! You're amazing. Congratulations for making it this far!

#Now let's get started!

#Getting Started
It's all in the article! You're going to clone this repository, edit the welcome_wall.md file to add an encouraging message (or some other cool communication) to the next person, and create your first pull request!

#Prerequisites
#Definitely

You need to have access to a computer
You need to have a GitHub account

#Probably
You might want to check out the article first
You should have Git installed on your computer if you can
You might want to know how to access your terminal so you can practice the whole thing
It would be good to have a text editor so that you can grab the file and edit it on your computer just because learning is what this project is about.
